# hive-RISC

A course project of Computer Architecture. To implement a pipeline CPU 
- using Chisel and Scala
- modified by riscv-sodor
- using MIPS instruction set (instead of RISC-V instruction set)
- Cache and Memory parts modified by Tao Jin's code
- verified at Digilent NEXYS 3

All instructions in the memory, and it executes step-by-step through buttons and switchs at NEXYS.
